# LittleBenComputer
An implementation of Little Man Computer written in Python

## Why?
Because of who I am as a person

## Usage
To run LittleBenComputer, run the Python file from the command line. Pass the path to the LBC code as the first argument.
```
python lbc.py <filepath>
```

Example:
```
python lbc.py test.lbc
```

The `.lbc` extension is not required: anything should work.
